                    <p class="card-text">
                        Customer churn, also known as customer attrition or customer turnover, refers to the phenomenon where customers stop doing business with a company or service. In today's competitive business landscape, understanding and predicting customer churn has become crucial for maintaining sustainable growth and profitability.

                    <p class="card-text">
                        The importance of churn prediction cannot be overstated in modern business operations. Here's why:

                            <strong>Cost Efficiency:</strong> Acquiring new customers is significantly more expensive than retaining existing ones. Studies show that acquiring a new customer can cost 5-25 times more than retaining an existing one.
                        </li>
                        <li class="mb-3">
                            <strong>Revenue Impact:</strong> A 5% increase in customer retention can lead to a 25-95% increase in profits, according to research by Bain & Company.

                        <li class="mb-3">
                            <strong>Business Growth:</strong> Loyal customers not only provide steady revenue but also act as brand ambassadors, bringing in new customers through referrals.

                            <strong>Competitive Advantage:</strong> Understanding churn patterns helps businesses identify and address weaknesses in their service or product offerings before competitors do.
